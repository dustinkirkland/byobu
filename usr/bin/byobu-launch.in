# 1) Prevent recursion, and multiple sourcing of profiles with the BYOBU_SOURCED_PROFILE environment variable.
# 2) Respect environment variables (LC_BYOBU and BYOBU_DISABLE) passable over SSH to disable
#    Byobu launch.  This puts that configurability on the SSH client,
#    in addition to the server.
#    To use over SSH, your /etc/ssh/sshd_config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config
#    must pass this variable with AcceptEnv and SendEnv.
#    Note that LC_* are passed by default on Debian/Ubuntu, we'll optionally
#    support LC_BYOBU=0
#    And in your local bashrc:
#      $HOME/.bashrc:  export LC_BYOBU=0
#    or edit your sshd_config, ssh_config, and set:
#      $HOME/.bashrc:  export BYOBU_DISABLE=1
