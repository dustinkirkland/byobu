.SH NAME
byobu\-select\-session \- select and connect to a byobu session

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-select\-session\fP is an application that lists the available screen sessions running on the system, and prompts the user to select one.  If an invalid selection is chosen 3 times in a row, the user is connected to the youngest session.  If only one session exists, the user is connected to that session.  If no sessions exist, a new session is created.

Named sessions that begin with a "." are "hidden" from \fBbyobu\-select\-session\fP(1).  This is useful, for instance, if you do not want a session to be automatically selected at login.  Example:
  byobu -S .hidden
