install locally, using the following instructions...

 0) If you have pulled the source from the upstream bzr repository
    (bzr branch lp:byobu) then you first need to run:
      ./debian/rules autoconf
 1) Or download the latest version (>= 3.0) from:
      https://launchpad.net/byobu/+download
 2) Extract:
      tar zxvf byobu*.tar.gz
 3) Configure:
      cd byobu*
      ./configure --prefix="$HOME/byobu"
 4) Build:

      echo "export PATH=$HOME/byobu/bin:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
      . $HOME/.bashrc
 7) Run:

Note that you will need to have a few dependencies installed:
 * tmux >= 1.5 and screen
 * python-newt (if you want to use Byobu's configuration utility)
 * gsed (if your sed implementation doesn't support -i)
