Screen is a powerful program that allows your terminal session to use
multiple windows and retain context among multiple logins.
This version of screen is configured with a task bar at the bottom of
the window that shows system status, pending updates, and tabs for
open windows.

F5    Close current window   |  F9    Configure screen-profiles
                             |  F12   Lock this terminal
Commands:
