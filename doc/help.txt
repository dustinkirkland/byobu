GNU Screen is a powerful program that allows your terminal session to
use multiple windows, and retain context among multiple logins.

This version of screen is configured with a task bar at the bottom of
the window that shows: open windows, the current-OS, reboot-required,
updates-available, system-load, cpu-info, memory-info, and date/time.
