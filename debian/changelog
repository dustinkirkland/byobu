  [ Dustin Kirkland ]

    updated with mem and load status scripts

  * screen-launcher, screen-install, debian/install: install screen-launcher
    to /usr/bin, drop the symlinking to ~/.screen-launcher, just install by
    adding /usr/bin/screen-launcher to ~/.bashrc; install screen-launcher
    to both bashrc and bash_profile
