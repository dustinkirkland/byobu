  Drop the distro name in generated profiles
  * debian/install: fix installation of profiles
  * debian/rules: don't create the ubuntu profile symlink
  * debian/screen-profiles-extras.install: no longer need to install
    the distro-specific profiles
  * profiles/generate: generate profiles which do not have ubuntu-
    prepended
  * select-screen-profile: remove the ubuntu specific profile handling
  * screen: fix broken symlinks to ubuntu-* profiles
  * screen-profiles: drop special ubuntu handling
  * screen-profiles-export: drop ubuntu prepending

  * screen: default to the light profile, if unspecified; this should be
    acceptable now that the F9:Menu prompt is always shown, and from there,
    any user can easily change their profile; just touch the windows config
    file since F5 reloads reopens all windows; launch with motd+shell if
    no args to screen are specified
  * keybindings/common: don't force users to name a window on F2 window
    creation
  * debian/postrm: remove the || true on the diversion removal, per Debian
    ITP; I suppose we want to know if the diversion removal failed
  * screen-profiles, screen-profiles-status: default uptime status to 'on',
    generally useful, and pretty compact

    totally default (no status file) configuration

  * bin/*: route and ifconfig are in /sbin, fully qualify
  * Performance improvements, LP: #360759
    - screen-profiles-status: use home bin scripts, if available first,

      let them write to cache, and let the next cache check pick up the

screen-profiles (1.12-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * profiles/common, select-screen-profile: add support for sourcing
    individual user's ~/.screenrc-keybindings file
  * screen-launcher: sanitize user environment by touching sourced files,
    in case they don't exist
  * Updated several scripts license header to point to the GPLv3, which
    is the license this package uses (not GPLv2)

  [ Dustin Kirkland and Nicolas Barcet]
  * screen-profiles-helper: add HOME, SHARE, DOC global variables and use
    them where possible; add functionality to change the escape key
    sequence; dynamically populate current escape sequence in the help.txt
    display, LP: #317675

  * use gettext in screen-profiles-helper (LP: #317245)

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * keybindings/common: fix leading whitespace on new window creation
    LP: #317558
  * keybindings/common, doc/help.txt: change the default escape sequence
    back to ctrl-a
  * profiles/common, bin/updates-available: the updates-available script now
    caches its value, expiring that value every 60 minutes; so subsequent
    checks are much cheaper;  we can allow the screen status script to run
    more frequently now, since most will be cache checks; we'll really benefit
    from this in Jaunty
  * debian/control: remove buildeps on gettext, po4a, which are only called
    in the prebuild; depend on ${misc:Depends} with debhelper >= 5
  * debian/rules: use dh_testdir in get-orig-source, dh_clean to clean up
    build; run as 'debian/rules get-orig-source'; removing dh_installdirs as
    its not needed; add dh_md5sums
  * debian/dirs: not needed, removing
  * debian/copyright: updated to use canonical.com address, attribute
    Canonical copyright, and mention Nick as co-author
  * select-screen-profile.1: fixed typo
  * bin/*, *: use -e for shell scripts
  * bin/updates-available: cache updates available count in the user's
    homedir, rather than world-writable /var/tmp (race conditions exist)
  * screen-launcher.1, screen-profiles-helper.1: new manpages

    select-screen-profile to fix
  * screen-launcher, screen-install, debian/install: install screen-launcher
    to /usr/bin, drop the symlinking to ~/.screen-launcher, just install by
