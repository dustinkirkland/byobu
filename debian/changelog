  * byobu-launcher: print 'Launching Byobu...' banner for slower terminals,

    font for these, to help with dark colored tty's
  * bin/temp_c, bin/temp_f: fix display of yellow on dark tty's
  * bin/*: use bold for measurements, and non-bold for units; this really
    makes byobu's status items 'pop'!
  * bin/fan_speed, byobu-config, byobu.1, profiles/common,

  * byobu-config: improve the verbage of some of the menus, per
    review with the Canonical Design Team
  * statusrc, byobu-status, byobu-export, debian/install: source default
    status states, rather than the big case statement, performance
    improvement for all status, also reduces the number of places to
    touch when a new status script is added
  * byobu-status: move all of the cleanup hacks to byobu-janitor; create
    a find_script() function that allows for scripts in both /usr/lib and
    $HOME/.byobu
  * byobu, byobu-janitor, debian/install, profiles/common,

    their profile
  * bin/reboot_required, byobu-janitor, byobu-status, byobu.1,
    debian/postinst: display an <F5> next to the reboot symbol, if a byobu

    all status scripts from *-* to *_*; this allows us to source the
    ~/.byobu/status file, rather than grepping through it for configuration
    information, yielding significant performance improvements
  * profiles/common: massive rework of status frequencies; use prime numbers
    to minimize collisions; increase/decrease a few, based on statistical
    testing of required runtimes
  * bin/wifi_quality: significant performance improvements, remove unneeded
    route call, cache iwconfig output so that it's only called once

  * bin/disk_available, bin/disk_used, bin/hostname, bin/ip_address,

  * bin/cpu-freq: drop "cat" and just use awk, don't printf twice,

  * keybindings/common, doc/help.txt: change the default escape sequence
    back to ctrl-a
  * profiles/common, bin/updates-available: the updates-available script now
    caches its value, expiring that value every 60 minutes; so subsequent
    checks are much cheaper;  we can allow the screen status script to run
    more frequently now, since most will be cache checks; we'll really benefit
    from this in Jaunty
  * debian/control: remove buildeps on gettext, po4a, which are only called
    in the prebuild; depend on ${misc:Depends} with debhelper >= 5
  * debian/rules: use dh_testdir in get-orig-source, dh_clean to clean up
    build; run as 'debian/rules get-orig-source'; removing dh_installdirs as
    its not needed; add dh_md5sums
  * debian/dirs: not needed, removing
  * debian/copyright: updated to use canonical.com address, attribute
    Canonical copyright, and mention Nick as co-author
  * select-screen-profile.1: fixed typo
  * bin/*, *: use -e for shell scripts
  * bin/updates-available: cache updates available count in the user's
    homedir, rather than world-writable /var/tmp (race conditions exist)
  * screen-launcher.1, screen-profiles-helper.1: new manpages

    updated with mem and load status scripts

    to /usr/bin, drop the symlinking to ~/.screen-launcher, just install by
